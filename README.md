# ForeverBot
A simple discord bot I'm using for a server I'm a part of.

The link to invite the bot is [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=825521071120842783&permissions=0&scope=bot), although this is just full perms as I haven't configured the OAuth2 link yet.

## Installation
If you want to run it you should just need to `git clone https://https://github.com/Duwareon/ForeverBot.git`, `cd` into the directory, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dotenv and discord.py, and then run the program with `./main.py`.
